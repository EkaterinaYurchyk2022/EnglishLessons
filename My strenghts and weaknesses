I sometimes find it hard to say no to co-workers and I end up doing some of their work as well as my own. Initially, 
for some reason I felt obligated to help other workers with their tasks, but I soon realised that this was counter-
productive to my own work. After I started taking work home with me I decided to take the initiative and
have learned to distinguish between what duties are solely mine and which are my collegues.
