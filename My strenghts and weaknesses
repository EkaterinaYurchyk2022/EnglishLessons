I sometimes find it hard to say no to co-workers and I end up doing some of their work as well as my own. Initially, 
for some reason I felt obligated to help other workers with their tasks, but I soon realised that this was counter-
productive to my own work. After I started taking work home with me I decided to take the initiative and
have learned to distinguish between what duties are solely mine and which are my collegues.



I find it difficult at times waiting for others to come back to me when the completion of my own task depends on them.
I think it demonstrates that I can be impatient at times, and one particular external company commented
during a telephone conversation that she found me quite pushy to deal with at times. Obviously I opologised to her 
but I stressed that my pushiness was simply down to me wanting to get the job done for my emloyer. I am learning to be
more impatient but I guess I will always have that urge to get the job done as soon as possible.



I sometimes take on too much work and find it hard to delegate tasks to others. This was, in the past, resulted in me
feeling slightly overwhelmed with too much work and I have been logging online at the weekends just to keep up with
my work. I am now learning to take on tasks and complete them as quickly and accurately as possible,
before moving on to the next one. I now also realise it is important to delegate tasks to other people within
the team who might be better placed to do them quickly based on their workload.



If I'm being honest, I don't have my experience yet of dealing with external companies or stakeholders, but I'm fully
aware it's an area I need to develop if I am to become an all-round competent employee. To improve in this area, 
in my previous job, I decided to shadow my manager for a day to find out how she deals with external companies
and found the experience enlightening and highly informative. I think that, if Ieventually get more experience of working 
with external companies and stakeholders, it will just serve to improve my overall capabilities with a work-related role.
