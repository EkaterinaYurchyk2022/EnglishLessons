TS - an improved version of JS with increase readability, static compilation and intuitive interface.

Main advantages:

Optional static typing.
JS - a dynamically tiped language (the software will not treat type differences as errors until TS introduces 
optional static typing once declared a variable doesn't change its type and can only take certain values,
the compiler alerts developers to type related mistakes. It results an early bug catching and structured code.

Improved readability. 
JS offers few readability add-ons, a lot of errors need to be detected manually.
Early detection
Stable code
Defined types


TS provides a more informative version of code base,

Intellisense.
TS is capable of increasing the development speed
Microsoft developed instrument for code navigation called intellisense. 
It offers automatic code completion by hovering over a method name you'll see the properties and parameters.
