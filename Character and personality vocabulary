Questions for the interview:
What are your strengths/strong qualities/traits?
*Don’t give a laundry list of random skills.
- (incorrect) Well, I’m good at communication, organizing, teamwork, and I take initiative all the time - TOTALLY FORGETTABLE!

Instead:
Choose 2 or 3 important strengths that relate directly to the position you’re applying for.

Choose ones that will set you apart from others and give some evidence
(Ex.: If you’re applying for a marketing manager position you might say:
“People tell me that I’m a creative manager: I can motivate a team and make people feel appreciated. For example, 
our team recently tackled a tough project for a really demanding client”).









What are your weaknesses/weak qualities/traits?
* Don’t choose smth that is actually a strength
(ex.: Well, sometimes I’m too much of a perfectionist)
* Choose smth that isn’t central to the position you’re applying for
* Talk about how you’ve worked to improve this weakness
(ex.: In the past I’ve struggled with public speaking giving presentations to large groups of people at a conference,
that’s a real challenge. That said, I’ve joined toastmasters and I’ve been working hard to develop more confidence with this).
