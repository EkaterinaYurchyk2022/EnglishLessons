I am quite active in my spare time and I like to feel I am developing personally and professionally.
I enjoy keeping fit and I visit the gym three times a week.
Whilst I am not fitness obsessed, keeping fit helps me to maintain a positive mindset and it helps my concentration levels whilst at work.
I enjoy reading and I usually have a good book on the go. This helps improve my dictation and vocabulary and it also helps me to relax.
Finally I enjoy spending time with my family as again, this helps me to relax and it's important I give them some of my
spare time as they always support me in my work and they encourage me with my career aspirations and goals.
