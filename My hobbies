I am quite active in my spare time and I like to feel I am developing personally and professionally. I like to use my free time productively.
I visit the gym three times a week. Exercise helps me to maintain a positive mindset, it reduces stress and increases concentration levels. And also
I'm a member of an athletic club and from time to time take part in different competetions.

I enjoy reading. This improves use of words and vocabulary, helps me to learn, helps me to relax.

I am at my happies when I am learning new things and I have the discipline to sit down, apply myself and learn. Thet's why I started to study online courses
for front-end developer.

Finally I enjoy spending time with my family as again, this helps me to relax and it's important I give them some of my
spare time as they always support me in my work and they encourage me with my career aspirations and goals.
