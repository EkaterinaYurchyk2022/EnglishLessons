I am quite active in my spare time and I like to feel I am developing personally and professionally. I like to use my free time productively.
I visit the gym three times a week. Exercise helps me to maintain a positive mindset, it reduces stress and increases concentration levels.


//Whilst I am not fitness obsessed, keeping fit helps me to maintain a positive mindset and it helps my concentration levels whilst at work.

I enjoy reading. This improves use of words and vocabulary, helps me to learn, helps me to relax.



Finally I enjoy spending time with my family as again, this helps me to relax and it's important I give them some of my
spare time as they always support me in my work and they encourage me with my career aspirations and goals.
