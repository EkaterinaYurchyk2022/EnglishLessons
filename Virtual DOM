Real DOM
First things first, DOM stands for “Document Object Model”. The DOM in simple words represents the UI of your application. 
Everytime there is a change in the state of your application UI, the DOM gets updated to represent that change. 
Now the catch is frequently manipulating the DOM affects performance, making it slow.



What makes DOM manipulation slow?
The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Because of that, the changes and updates to the DOM are fast. 
But after the change, the updated element and it’s children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. 
The re-rendering or re-painting of the UI is what makes it slow. Therefore, the more UI components you have, 
the more expensive the DOM updates could be, since they would need to be re-rendered for every DOM update.
