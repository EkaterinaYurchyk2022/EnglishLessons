I'm working a regular job at a state enterprise. I have to get up at 6 in the morning. I have 2 children and my younger daughter goes to a kindergarden. 
So I prepare all the neccessary things for her and make breakfast.
Then my commute takes around an hour so I have to leave the house at half (past) seven at the latest.
I am at the office from eight-twenty till five-twenty. I can only take a short lanch break for about half an hour. I'm organized and cook once in two or three days 
so I can take food with me to work.
Every day I work almost the same hours. Sometimes I stay late or go on business when it's neccessary.
I'm at home at six at the earliest. At home I have too little time because I must take care of my daughters and study programming.
I try to spend at least three or four hours a day for my study. That's why I go to bed at midnight at the earliest.
I don't really like to get up early in the morning but have no choice. I'd rather go to bed at ten or eleven but now I have to be a night owl.
